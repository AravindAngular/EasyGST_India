# EasyGST_India

**Goods and Services Tax is a single tax regime that revolutionised the Tax Payment Architecture of India on July 1st 2017**

Although it transformed the system for the better, it arguably took the nation by storm. Literally, every business entity
today feels the need to undergo exhaustive training sessions and
spend extravagant amounts of money on people who understand GST accouting.
More on GST in India [here](http://www.gstindia.com/about/).

I therefore developed this software in the form of a Point of Sale (POS) web app using which firms/entities can conveniently save themselves from the arduous job of accounting based on this new regime.

### Features

* Automated reporting (whenever billing is done) for R1 form - the form which needs to be sent for tax returns - and option for R2 form which allows manual updation of accounting in case of erranrous input
* The user can check the reports between any two selected dates, making it easier for one to analyse sales
* Automated effect of taxes (central GGST and State GST and total GST) on selling price of the products
* Speedy billing process for customers coming again (stores customers information in database)
* Dynamic tables allowing for editing/ deletion of products and suppliers (for users) and editing/ deletion of tax-slabs (controlled by admins)
* Full application with an admin panel and a public side

### Prerequisites

The web application is recommended to be used in Chrome browser, although you may use others such as Safari, Opera, IE 10,11 and firefox.
