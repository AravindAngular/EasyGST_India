# EasyGST_India

**Goods and Services Tax is a single tax regime that revolutionised the Tax Payment Architecture of India on July 1st 2017**

Although it transformed the system for the better, it arguably took the nation by storm. Literally, every business entity
today feels the need to undergo exhaustive training sessions and
spend extravagant amounts of money on people who understand GST accouting.

I therefore developed this software in the form of a web app using which firms/entities can conveniently save themselves
from the arduous job of accounting based on this new regime.
